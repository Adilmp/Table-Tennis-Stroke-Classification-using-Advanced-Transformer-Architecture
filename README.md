Welcome to the repository for my final year project on Table Tennis Stroke Classification. This project leverages cutting-edge Video Vision Transformer (ViViT) technology to analyze and classify table tennis strokes from video data. The aim is to enhance the understanding of stroke mechanics and improve player training through accurate stroke recognition.
üöÄ Key Features:
=================
Advanced Video Analysis: Utilizes the Video Vision Transformer model to process and understand video sequences, enabling precise stroke classification.

High Accuracy: Achieves impressive classification accuracy through state-of-the-art deep learning techniques tailored for sports video analysis.

üìä How It Works:
=================

Video Input: The system takes video footage of table tennis matches or practice sessions.

Preprocessing: Videos are preprocessed to enhance quality and extract relevant frames.

Model Inference: The Video Vision Transformer analyzes the video frames and classifies the different types of strokes.

ü§ù Benefits:
Enhanced Training: Coaches and players can gain insights into stroke mechanics and improve their techniques.

Performance Analysis: Enables detailed performance analysis and comparison over time.

Research Contribution: Provides a robust framework for further research in sports video analysis and machine learning applications.
